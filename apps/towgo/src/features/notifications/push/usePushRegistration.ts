 * after the first. Re-registering on each launch is also how `last_seen_at` and
 * the app-version field stay true.
 *
 * REGISTRATION HAPPENS EVEN WITHOUT PERMISSION, with a null token. The row is
 * what lets the server know this install exists; it flips to a real token if
 * the user grants permission later, with no separate "now create it" path.
 *
 * ⚠ NEVER EXECUTED. No build exists for this app, so no token has ever been
 * minted and this has never run against the real `expo-notifications`.
