 *
 * This port — not the compliance worker or the CSV import that sit on top of it
 * — is the hard prerequisite for Track B Phases 13, 17 and 19:
 *   · 13 needs queue-backed notification fan-out with retries and a DLQ (§12.3).
 *   · 17 needs dispatch offer timers that are DURABLE and SINGLE-OWNER across N
 *     Fargate tasks. In-process `setTimeout` over N tasks double-assigns a
 *     fare-locked booking, which corrupts the ledger rather than degrading UX.
 *   · 19 needs a reconciliation sweep that runs ONCE, not N times against the
 *     same uncaptured payment.
 *
 * Everything here is therefore designed around durability and single-ownership,
 * not around convenience.
