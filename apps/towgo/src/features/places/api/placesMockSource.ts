 * Mock address search.

 * IT SEARCHES `recentLocations`, NOT A SECOND INVENTED LIST. That array is the
 * seven presets the booking screen offered before typing worked, and every entry
 * carries a real coordinate that the seeded `service_zones` agree with — so a
 * fare quoted in mock mode lands in the same zone it would against the real
 * backend. A separate mock gazetteer would drift from both.
 *
 * The mock is deliberately WORSE than the server's local gazetteer (seven
 * entries against twenty-one). Mock mode exists to demo the app with no backend
 * at all; it is not a second implementation of address search, and making it
 * comprehensive would invite it to be treated as one.
