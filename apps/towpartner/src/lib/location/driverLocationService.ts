/**
 * §11.8's location capture — the Android foreground service, the iOS background
 * mode, and the flush that gets fixes to the server.
 *
 * CAPTURE HAPPENS ONLY WHILE ONLINE OR ON A JOB (§20.4). That is a privacy
 * commitment, not a battery optimisation, and it is why nothing here starts on
 * app launch: `start()` is called by going online and `stop()` by going offline,
 * and there is no third caller. The Play background-location review asks exactly
 * this question, and "we track drivers whenever the app is installed" is the
 * answer that fails it.
 *
 * A FOREGROUND SERVICE IS NOT OPTIONAL ON ANDROID. Since Android 10, background
 * location for a non-foreground app is throttled to a few updates an hour, and
 * since 12 a backgrounded app cannot start one at all. A tow that reports its
 * position four times an hour is not live tracking. The persistent notification
 * is the price, and Play policy requires it to be there anyway.
 *
 * ⚠ NONE OF THIS HAS RUN ON A DEVICE. `expo-location`'s background APIs need a
 * dev client, and no build has ever been produced for this app. The foreground
 * service, the Doze behaviour and the §11.10 6–8 %/h battery target are all
 * UNVERIFIED — see `tobedone.md`.
