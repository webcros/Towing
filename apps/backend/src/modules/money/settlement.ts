/**
 * §14.3 booking settlement, as pure arithmetic: gross → commission → pool →
 * the ledger legs that get posted.
 *
 * **Why the split happens here and not at payout time.** §3.4 and §9.3.7 both
 * say "split at payout layer" while §14.3 says the fleet split is "two ledger
 * credits in one transaction". `src/db/seed/seed.ts` — which the phase plan
 * names as the executable specification — implements the latter, and 755
 * seeded ledger rows plus the third seed invariant depend on it.
 *
 * The two readings reconcile: the split is computed in the *money* layer
 * (here) rather than in pricing, and a payout draws only the fleet's own
 * already-split wallet balance. **A payout never re-splits anything.** Moving
 * the arithmetic to payout time would mean a fleet's wallet held the driver's
 * money until withdrawal, which is both wrong on the books and unpayable to a
 * driver who leaves the fleet.
 *
 * `commission_debit` is deliberately never produced. The platform has no
 * wallet, so commission has no counterparty leg — it lives as
 * `bookings.commission_amount` and by the pool's absence. See the reserved
 * marker on `walletTxnTypeEnum`.
