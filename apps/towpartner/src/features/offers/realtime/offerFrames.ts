/**
 * The `/driver` socket's job frames, applied to the query cache.
 *
 * MODULE FUNCTIONS RATHER THAN CALLBACKS FROM A COMPONENT, and that matters
 * here more than it looks. The socket is connected inside `usePresence`, which
 * lives on the home screen; handlers closed over that component's render would
 * keep working only for as long as it stayed mounted, and an offer arriving
 * while the driver was reading their earnings would land in a closure nobody was
 * listening to. Nothing below touches React.
 *
 * The cache is the single meeting point for the socket, the §19.2 poll and the
 * push tap — so the takeover gate watches one thing and cannot be shown twice
 * for the same offer by two different deliveries.
