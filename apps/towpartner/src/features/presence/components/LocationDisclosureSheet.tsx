/**
 * PROMINENT DISCLOSURE — shown BEFORE the OS permission prompt, every time the
 * driver goes online without having accepted it.
 *
 * THIS IS A PLAY STORE REQUIREMENT, NOT A UX FLOURISH. Google's background
 * location policy requires an in-app disclosure that (a) appears before the
 * runtime prompt, (b) names the feature that needs the data, (c) says the
 * collection continues when the app is closed or not in use, and (d) has an
 * affirmative accept action that is not merely "OK" on a dialog the user has to
 * dismiss to continue. Apps are routinely rejected for having the wording but
 * showing it after the prompt, or for burying it in a privacy policy link.
 *
 * The review itself is human, can take weeks, and can reject late — which is why
 * SETUP-CHECKLIST item 3 flags starting it during this phase rather than at
 * submission.
 *
 * ⚠ NEVER SEEN ON A DEVICE, and never submitted to that review.
