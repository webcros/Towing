/**

 * whenever the app is backgrounded, because a background task cannot assume a
 * live socket in Doze — and that is most of a driver's day. What the socket buys
 * is the two things REST cannot do: a server→driver channel for `config:update`
 * (so ping cadence and battery behaviour change without an app release), and the
 * room Phase 17 delivers job offers to.
 *
 * Everything here degrades to nothing gracefully. A failed ticket, a refused
 * handshake or `REALTIME_ENABLED=false` server-side leaves the driver fully
 * functional on REST — which is why none of the failures below are surfaced to
 * the UI.
 *
 * ⚠ NEVER RUN ON A DEVICE.
