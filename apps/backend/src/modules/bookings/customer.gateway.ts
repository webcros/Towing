/**
 * The `/customer` namespace (§16.6) — Phase 17.
 *
 * WHY IT EXISTS NOW AND NOT IN PHASE 18. §9.1.6's acceptance criterion is that
 * "wave transitions reflect the actual engine state (no fake progress)", and the
 * engine advances a wave every twenty seconds. A ten-second REST poll would show
 * the customer roughly every other wave — real state, but a stuttering account
 * of it. More to the point, Phase 18 needs this namespace for live driver
 * position regardless, and building it here means the offer engine has somewhere
 * to publish rather than emitting into a room nobody joins. That is the same
 * argument that had Phase 16 build `driver:{id}` for Phase 17's benefit.
 *
 * ACCEPTS NOTHING, like `/fleet` and unlike `/driver`. The customer has nothing
 * to tell the server over a socket — cancelling is a REST call with an audit
 * trail — so `CustomerClientToServerEvents` is empty and stays empty.
 *
 * THE ROOM IS SCOPED TO ONE BOOKING, AND THE BOOKING ID COMES FROM THE TICKET.
 * `WsTicketService` mints it only after `POST /v1/bookings/:id/realtime/ticket`
 * has proved the caller owns that booking, so ownership is checked once, on a
 * route that already does it, and nothing the socket says afterwards can reach a
 * room name.
