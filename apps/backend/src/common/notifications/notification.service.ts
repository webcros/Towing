/**
 * THE PRODUCER-FACING SEAM. Every notification in the system starts here.
 *
 * A producer calls `emit('driver.kyc.approved', { driverId, … })` with DOMAIN
 * IDS and nothing else — never a phone number, never a channel, never a
 * template. What that becomes is the registry's business (invariant 69).
 *
 * WHAT `emit()` DOES SYNCHRONOUSLY, in one transaction:
 *   1. writes the `notification_events` row — the durable record; and
 *   2. resolves recipients and writes their `notifications` inbox rows.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES NOT DO: talk to a vendor. It enqueues `notifications.fanout`
 * and returns (invariant 72). A provider outage must never roll back a
 * completed money transition — the best-effort `try/catch` wrappers already in
 * `payouts.service.ts` and `compliance.service.ts` were buying that property by
 * remembering to catch at every site; enqueueing gives it structurally.
 *
 * WHY THE INBOX IS WRITTEN HERE AND NOT IN THE WORKER (invariant 74). The bell
 * has to be correct even when nothing is delivered: `NOTIFY_ENABLED=false`,
 * every channel on the log adapter, a recipient with no push token, and —
 * critically — `QUEUE_ENABLED=false`, which `src/test/setup.ts` sets for the
 * whole suite and which `bullmq.adapter.ts` handles by logging and dropping the
 * job. Writing the inbox in the worker would leave the in-app centre untestable
 * and empty in every zero-credential demo, which is precisely what this phase
 * exists to make demonstrable.
