 * capture, Phase 20's admin cancel/reassign/dispute. Built any other way, each
 * of them invents its own transition rules, and they disagree the first time
 * two of them touch the same booking — which is exactly the moment nobody is
 * looking.
 *

 * the `booking_status_history` row. A history row written outside this service
 * is a history that can lie.
