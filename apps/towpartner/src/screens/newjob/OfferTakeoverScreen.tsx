/**
 * §6.3's offer, as a full-screen takeover.
 *
 * A BOTTOM-TAB SCREEN CANNOT DO THIS, which is the whole reason it exists. A
 * driver has twenty seconds, is very likely holding a steering wheel, and the
 * offer arrived while they were looking at something else — or at nothing. The
 * screen has to arrive over whatever is showing, be unmissable, and be decidable
 * at a glance, which is why the net figure and the ring are above everything the
 * Figma card already carries.
 *
 * SOUND IS DELIBERATELY ABSENT. A distinct alert tone needs an audio asset that
 * has to be licensed, and — because Android ignores every change to a
 * notification channel once it exists — a `job-offer-v2` channel to carry it.
 * What ships is haptics plus the ring; the backgrounded case already alerts
 * through Phase 13's high-priority `job-offer-v1` channel at `importance: MAX`
 * with `bypassDnd`, which is the part that actually wakes a phone in Doze.
 * Recorded in `ToBeDoneEhsan.md` rather than faked with a placeholder sound.
 *
 * ⚠ NEVER RUN ON A DEVICE. No dev-client build exists for this app, so the
 * takeover, the haptics and the ring have never been seen move.
