 * §7 fare engine — pure arithmetic, integer paise in, integer paise out.
 *
 * PROMOTED FROM `db/seed/pricing.ts` IN PHASE 14, not rewritten. That file was a
 * complete and unit-tested §7.1/§7.2/§7.3 implementation that lived under
 * `db/seed` and was imported only by the seeder; the slabs move here, the
 * fixture RNG (`createRng`/`pick`/`weighted`) stays there, and `pricing.spec.ts`
 * moved with the slabs. Phase 7 had already promoted the §3.3 bands, the
 * commission formula and the §14.3 split into `@towing/api-contracts` — those
 * are re-exported below rather than re-implemented, for exactly the reason that
 * move was made: the seed and the live path must be provably the same function,
 * not two implementations that agree today.
 *
 * TWO DELIBERATE BEHAVIOUR CHANGES FROM THE SEED VERSION, both documented at
 * their call site below:
 *  1. Band C no longer draws a random point in the §7.3 range — it interpolates.
 *  2. Surge applies to the pre-surge SUBTOTAL, not to the base alone.
 *
 * All arithmetic is integer paise; conversion to the NUMERIC(12,2) rupee strings
 * the schema stores happens only at `toRupees`. Floats never touch money.

 * tow twice must give the same number. `rules` took its place and defaults to
 * the launch matrix, so every slab and roadside assertion in the promoted spec
 * holds byte-identical.
 *
 * BAND C INTERPOLATES. §7.3 gives ranges, not points: 100–150 km is
 * ₹16,000–₹20,000. The fare scales linearly from the floor at the band's lower
 * bound to the ceiling at its upper bound, then rounds to whole rupees (long

 * — a 149 km tow never costs more than a 151 km one — and always lands inside
 * the published range, which is what lets the promoted range assertions stand.

 * Band C is "Flatbed hauling", so `vehicleClass` is not consulted past
 * `LONG_DISTANCE_FLOOR_KM`. The seed only ever generated >100 km distances for
 * flatbed bookings, so this is also exactly the behaviour it had.
