/**
 * The §5.1 booking OTP — minted at confirm, handed to the driver at pickup.
 *
 * STORED AS A DIGEST, NEVER AS THE CODE. `bookings.booking_otp` was plain
 * `text` holding the live code until migration 0012. Phase 13 declined to route
 * OTPs through the notification spine specifically because writing a live code
 * into a table with no TTL "reverses the hash-at-rest posture
 * `login_challenges.code_hash` has" — a plaintext code sitting on a booking row
 * for the life of the trip was the same mistake, one table over.
 *
 * WHICH CREATES A PROBLEM THIS CLASS EXISTS TO SOLVE. §9.1.7 wants the code
 * shown on the tracking screen, and a digest cannot be un-hashed — so a naive
 * implementation must mint a NEW code on every read. That is wrong in the one
 * moment that matters: the customer reads a code aloud, their screen refetches
 * in the background, and the driver types a code the server has already
 * replaced.
 *
 * So the durable store stays hashed and the readable code lives in Redis for
 * exactly the length of its window. Re-reading inside the window returns the
 * same code; after it, a fresh one with a fresh clock. Redis already holds
 * sessions and idempotency records, the entry expires on its own, and nothing
 * survives in Postgres but the digest.
 *
 * THE 30-MINUTE WINDOW RUNS FROM RETRIEVAL, NOT FROM CONFIRM. §5.1 mints at
 * confirm and §9.1.7 says "one-time, expires 30 min" and "never visible before
 * assignment" — but a search plus a cross-city drive can outrun thirty minutes,
 * and a customer holding a dead code at the handover has no way out except
 * cancelling a booking they still want. Minted at confirm, unreadable until
 * `assigned`, and the first read starts the clock.
