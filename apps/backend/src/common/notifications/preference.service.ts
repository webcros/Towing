 * producer that decided "should I send this?" is a producer that can decide
 * wrong, and there would be one such decision per emitter forever. Here there
 * is exactly one.
 *
 * The opt-out surface is deliberately small. `subjectNotificationPrefsSchema`
 * carries a key ONLY for a category a person may legally switch off; everything
 * else is unsuppressible by construction rather than by a default that a future
 * migration could flip. A user opt-out must never be able to suppress a KYC
 * rejection, a payout failure, or — from Phase 20 — an SOS.
