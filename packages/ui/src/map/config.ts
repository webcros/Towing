 * iOS renders through Apple Maps with no key, no billing account and no
 * configuration. Android has no keyless provider: without a Maps SDK key
 * `react-native-maps` draws a blank grey grid with a Google watermark, which is
 * strictly worse than the placeholder — it looks like the app is broken rather
 * than like a map is pending. No key exists yet (SETUP-CHECKLIST item 7).
