 * handset routinely land on two tasks (a REST post and a socket frame, or just
 * two POSTs over a keep-alive pool), both read the same stored seq, and both
 * write — so the OLDER one can win and the marker jumps backwards. "Late
 * packets discarded server-side" would then hold on one node and not on a
 * cluster, which is the worst kind of guarantee: true in every test and false
 * in production.
 *
 * Everything the write needs happens inside the script, so the accepted path
 * costs exactly one round trip: compare, store the fix, refresh the TTL, GEOADD
 * into the driver's zone set, and hand back the cached identity the fleet
 * fan-out needs.
 *
 * ⚠ THE GEO KEY IS BUILT IN LUA from a prefix, because the zone is read from the
 * hash inside the script and therefore cannot be declared in KEYS. Safe on
 * standalone Redis and on ElastiCache with cluster mode disabled, which is what
 * `Aws/02` specifies. On a real cluster the two keys would need a shared hash
 * tag — recorded here rather than discovered at cutover.
