/**
 * §3.3 commission bands + §14.3 split math, in integer paise.

 * Lives in api-contracts, not the backend, for three reasons:
 *  1. this package is already the shared money vocabulary (`paiseSchema`,
 *     `rupeeStringToPaise`, `paiseToRupeeString`) and already ships non-schema
 *     functions, so this is not a precedent change;
 *  2. `commissionPaise` is genuinely part of the contract — the split DTO
 *     carries `commissionPaise` and a client must be able to verify it;
 *  3. the seed (`apps/backend/src/db/seed/pricing.ts`) and the live settlement
 *     path must be provably the same function, not two implementations that
 *     agree today.
 *
 * §7's only rounding rule: "All computation in paise precision; commission
 * rounded half-up to the paisa; driver net = total − commission (so the two
 * always sum exactly)." Every function here is integer-in / integer-out.
