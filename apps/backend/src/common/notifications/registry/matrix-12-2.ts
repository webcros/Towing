/**
 * A LITERAL TRANSCRIPTION OF SPEC §12.2 — all sixteen rows, in spec order,
 * with the exact channel cells the table gives.
 *
 * ⚠ THIS FILE IS THE SPEC, NOT THE IMPLEMENTATION. It is deliberately dumb
 * data with no behaviour, so that `registry.spec.ts` can compare what the
 * product PROMISED against what the code actually registers.
 *
 * ⚠ EDITING A ROW TO MAKE A TEST PASS IS THE FAILURE MODE THIS EXISTS TO
 * PREVENT. If a row is wrong, the spec document is wrong and both change
 * together, in a commit that says so. If a row is not implemented yet, it gets
 * an `unregisteredUntilPhase` entry in `triggers.ts` — it does NOT get deleted
 * from here, and it does NOT get silently dropped.
 *
 * The mechanism this enables: every later phase that emits an event wires its
 * §12.2 row in the same commit, because `registry.spec.ts` fails on any row
 * that is neither registered nor explicitly deferred, and prints the deferred
 * ones by name so nobody has to remember they exist. Without it, "we forgot to
 * notify the customer" is discovered by a customer.
