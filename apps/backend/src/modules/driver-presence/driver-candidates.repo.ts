/**

 * PHASE 16 SHIPS THE READ; PHASE 17 SHIPS THE SCORE. What lives here is
 * everything that decides whether a driver is a candidate AT ALL: zone
 * membership, proximity, and liveness. The §6.2 weighted scorer, the eligibility
 * joins against capabilities and truck compliance, and the offer lock are the
 * matcher's, and deliberately not pre-empted here — a scorer written before its
 * first real consumer is a scorer written against guesses.
 *
 * `/drivers/nearby` is this phase's consumer and needs only the count and the
 * coordinates, which is exactly the subset that is safe to expose (§11.9).
