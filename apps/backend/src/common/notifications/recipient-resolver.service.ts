/**
 * THE ONLY THING IN THE SYSTEM THAT TURNS A SUBJECT ID INTO AN ADDRESS.
 *
 * That is the fix for the class of bug this phase inherited: before Phase 13,
 * `compliance.service.ts` passed a fleet id and `payouts.service.ts` an owner
 * id straight into `NotifyParams.to`, a field documented as "E.164 phone or
 * email address". Against `LogNotificationAdapter` that printed a UUID and
 * nobody noticed; against a real provider it is a 400 on every send, or worse a
 * silent accept. Producers now emit domain ids and never see an address at all
 * (invariant 69).
 *
 * Resolution happens at FAN-OUT time, not emit time, so a phone number changed
 * between the two yields the current one. It is also why a replayed event is
 * safe: the addresses are re-derived, never carried in the payload.
