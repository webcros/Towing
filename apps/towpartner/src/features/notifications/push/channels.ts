/**
 * THE HIGH-PRIORITY OFFER CHANNEL, created now and deliberately unused.
 *
 * Phase 17's `job:offer` gives a driver ~20 seconds to accept, and it has to
 * arrive when the app is backgrounded and the phone is in Doze — which is
 * exactly when a WebSocket is not connected and a normal-priority push is
 * batched until the next maintenance window. A channel created for the first
 * time on the day dispatch ships is a channel nobody has ever seen behave.
 *
 * ⚠ THE CHANNEL ID IS VERSIONED FOR A REASON. Android IGNORES every change to
 * an existing channel's importance, sound and vibration once it has been
 * created — the user owns those settings from that point on. So Phase 17 cannot
 * "add the distinct sound" to this channel; it has to create `job-offer-v2`
 * with the sound and stop using this one. Bump the suffix, never edit in place.
 *
 * `sound: 'default'` for now, because a distinct alert tone needs an actual
 * audio asset that has to be sourced and licensed (`ToBeDoneEhsan.md`). The
 * Doze bypass does NOT come from the sound — it comes from `importance: MAX`
 * plus `bypassDnd`, both of which are here — so the mechanism that matters is
 * already in place and testable.
 *
 * ⚠ NEVER EXECUTED. No build exists for this app, so this channel has never
 * been created on a device and neither its presentation nor its Doze behaviour
 * has been observed.
