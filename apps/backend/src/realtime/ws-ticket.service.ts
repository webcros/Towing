 * are a `typ` claim the guard must remember to reject, or a second secret. An
 * opaque random string in Redis has neither problem, and gains single-use
 * semantics and instant revocability for free.
 *
 * The browser is why this exists at all: it holds only httpOnly cookies, so it
 * physically cannot put a bearer on the handshake.
