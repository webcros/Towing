/**
 * THE GOLDEN FILE. Re-price every seeded booking through the live engine and
 * assert it reproduces the fare already stored on the row.
 *
 * Why this is worth having, in the plan's own words: the Phase 3 seed was
 * already §7-correct, so it becomes the oracle for free. 506 bookings spanning
 * every service, both vehicle classes, all three bands and distances from 1 km
 * to 450 km are a far broader fare corpus than any hand-written table of cases,
 * and they were written by code that predates this phase.
 *
 * WHAT IT CAN AND CANNOT PROVE. The seed chooses each booking's SCENARIO with an
 * RNG — was it at night, did the zone surge, did the driver wait — and those
 * flags are not stored on the row. So a re-price from stored columns cannot
 * reproduce `night_charge` or `surge_amount`, and asserting on them would be
 * asserting on a coin flip. What IS reproducible from `(service_type,
 * vehicle_class, distance_km)` alone is the BASE FARE, and what is reproducible
 * from the stored `total` is the entire §3.3/§7 commission split. Those are the
 * two things this file pins, and between them they cover the slab tables, the
 * roadside fares, the Band C interpolation, band resolution and the half-up
 * rounding.
 *
 * If this ever fails, the engine and the seed have diverged — which since Phase
 * 14 should be impossible, because the seed calls the engine.
