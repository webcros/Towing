/**
 * The deterministic RNG the seeder and the location simulator share.
 *
 * WHAT LEFT IN PHASE 14. This file used to own the §7 fare engine too — the
 * §7.1/§7.2 slabs, the §7.3 long-distance ranges and `baseFarePaise`. Those are
 * now `modules/pricing/pricing.math.ts` and, at runtime, rows in `pricing_rules`:
 * §6.7 requires them to change without a deploy, which a `const` in a seed file
 * cannot. `pricing.spec.ts` moved with them and is now `pricing.math.spec.ts`.
 *
 * What left before that, in Phase 7: the §3.3 bands, the commission formula and
 * the §14.3 split went to `@towing/api-contracts`, so the seed and the live
 * `LedgerService` are provably the same arithmetic rather than two
 * implementations that happen to agree. They are re-exported here so this
 * module's callers are unchanged.
 *
 * What stays: `createRng` and its two helpers are a FIXTURE concern. They pick
 * which scenario a seeded booking represents — was it at night, did it surge,
 * how far was it. The arithmetic that turns that scenario into money is the
 * engine's, and `seed.ts` now calls it rather than owning a second copy.
