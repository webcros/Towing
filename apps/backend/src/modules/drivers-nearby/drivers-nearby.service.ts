/**
 * §11.9's "drivers near me" — the supply signal the customer's home map draws.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES NOT RETURN IS THE FEATURE. No id, no name, no plate, no rating,
 * no per-driver ETA: §11.9 forbids identity pre-assignment, because showing
 * "Suresh, 4.8★" before dispatch has run promises a specific driver the matcher
 * has not chosen and may never offer the job to. TowGo's `NearbyDriver` type
 * carried exactly those three fields from Phase 12's mock; they are deleted
 * rather than served.
 *
 * IT REUSES THE DISPATCH CANDIDATE STORE, and that is the point of the phase.
 * The customer sees precisely the supply that the matcher would consider —
 * same zone partition, same freshness rule — so a map showing three trucks and
 * a search that finds nobody cannot disagree.
