/**
 * The `/driver` namespace (§16.6) — Phase 16.
 *
 * LIVES WITH ITS FEATURE, NOT IN `realtime/` BESIDE `FleetGateway`. The fleet
 * gateway sits there because its consumers do — the positions relay and the
 * metrics broadcaster are realtime infrastructure with no feature module of
 * their own. This gateway is a second door onto the presence pipeline and needs
 * `LocationIngestService` and `DriverPresenceService`, so putting it in
 * `RealtimeModule` would have made `RealtimeModule` and `DriverPresenceModule`
 * import each other. A `forwardRef` would compile; this arrangement means there
 * is no cycle to work around.
 *
 * THIS IS THE FIRST GATEWAY IN THE CODEBASE THAT ACCEPTS INPUT, and the reason
 * it is a second namespace rather than two more events on `/fleet`. `/fleet`'s
 * guarantee is that its `ClientToServerEvents` is empty, so nothing a browser
 * sends can influence a room; widening it here would spend that guarantee on
 * the console's behalf to buy the driver app a message it can equally well have
 * on its own namespace.
 *
 * The property that replaces it here: `handleLocationUpdate` reads its driver
 * from `socket.data`, which was written once at handshake from a redeemed
 * server-side ticket. `DriverLocationPing` carries no driver id at all, so there
 * is nothing in the message for a handler to be tempted by — the same shape
 * `RealtimeRelayService`'s tenancy warning asks for on the ingestion path.
 *
 * `@SkipThrottling` for the reason `FleetGateway` documents: `ThrottlerGuard` is
 * a global `APP_GUARD` whose `getRequestResponse` yields the socket on a WS
 * context, so every `@SubscribeMessage` would throttle under one garbage key —
 * and unlike `/fleet`, this namespace actually HAS a message handler, so the bug
 * would be live rather than theoretical. Ping-rate abuse is bounded by the
 * `seq` compare-and-set (a flood of stale numbers is discarded in one Redis
 * round trip) and by the ticket being single-use.
