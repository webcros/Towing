/**

 * before the first line of code. Wave position lives on the booking row, offer
 * timers are BullMQ delayed jobs, and a Redis lock keeps two workers off the
 * same search. Twenty-second offer timers as in-process `setTimeout` over N
 * stateless Fargate tasks produce double-assignment — two drivers against one
 * fare-locked booking — which corrupts the ledger rather than degrading UX.
 *
 * ⚠ `runWave` AND `expireOffer` ARE PLAIN PUBLIC METHODS, and the queue workers
 * below are one-line delegations to them. That is not incidental: the entire
 * test suite runs with `QUEUE_ENABLED=false` (see `test/setup.ts` — a live
 * worker on the shared test Redis would race every spec), so the engine has to
 * be drivable without BullMQ. It is also the better shape — the specs exercise
 * the real logic rather than the queue's delivery semantics, which
 * `queue.e2e.spec.ts` already covers on its own.

 * 3992 in under two minutes, hammering Redis and Postgres the whole way. The
 * unit test asserting `nextDelayMs === 0` was perfectly satisfied; only
 * `pnpm bench:dispatch` against a live backend showed it.
 *
 * What the rule actually means is "do not wait out a twenty-second offer
 * timeout that nobody is holding" — the alternative that motivates it. Two
 * seconds still walks the whole five-rung ladder in ten seconds instead of a
 * hundred, which is the entire benefit, and it cannot spin: past the last rung

 * advances immediately" is a real §6.4 rule with a real cost when it regresses —
 * a quiet zone would burn an eighth of its search deadline per empty wave — and
 * a rule nothing can assert is a rule that will quietly stop being true.
