 * `GET/PUT /v1/admin/dispatch-config` (§16.5) — Phase 17.
 *
 * BUILT ON `common/dispatch-config.ts`, NOT BESIDE IT. That file already models
 * both scopes and states the rule this API has to honour: the `dispatch_config`
 * TABLE holds what is global (scorer weights, the stale-ping threshold) and the
 * `service_zones.dispatch_config` COLUMN holds what is per-zone (radius ladder,
 * offer timing, wave size). Re-declaring either shape here would give the matcher
 * and the admin form two schemas to disagree about, which is exactly the
 * outcome Phase 14 created that file to prevent.
 *
 * §6.7 requires every knob below to change with NO DEPLOY, and Phase 17's engine
 * reads all of them at query time — so an edit through this route takes effect on
 * the next wave, not on the next release.
