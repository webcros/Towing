/**
 * The customer's two pricing routes (§16.2).
 *
 * `@Realms('customer')` IS MANDATORY, NOT DECORATION. A controller with no
 * `@Realms()` is FLEET-ONLY (invariant 45) — the default that let eleven Phase-9
 * controllers keep byte-identical behaviour when the realm system landed. Omit
 * it here and a customer's own estimate route 403s every customer.
 *
 * Both routes ride the default `reads` bucket. An estimate is a read in every
 * way that matters to the throttler: it writes nothing, it is re-requested every
 * time the pin moves, and §9.1.5's "surge changes pre-confirm → estimate
 * updates" is a legitimate reason to call it repeatedly. The 20/min `money`
 * bucket is for writes that move money, which this does not.
