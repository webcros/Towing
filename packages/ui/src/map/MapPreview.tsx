/**
 * Map facade — the seam this file's header promised since Phase 12: "point this
 * at a react-native-maps implementation (`MapPreview.maps`) with the same props
 * — no consumer changes required". Phase 16 does exactly that, and no consumer
 * changed: the four screens already rendering `<MapPreview />` were not touched
 * to make the map appear.
 *
 * Which implementation runs is decided by `configureMaps()`, called once at app
 * boot — see `config.ts` for why that is a slot rather than an env read.
 *
 * ⚠ NEVER OBSERVED ON A DEVICE. `react-native-maps` is a native module and no
 * dev client has been built for either app, so the native path is typechecked,
 * bundle-clean and prebuild-clean, and has never drawn a tile. Same honest
 * standing as Phase 13's push adapters. See `tobedone.md`.
