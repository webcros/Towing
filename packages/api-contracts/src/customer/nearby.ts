/**
 * `GET /v1/drivers/nearby` (§11.9) — the "there is supply here" signal the
 * customer's home map draws.
 *
 * WHAT IS DELIBERATELY ABSENT IS THE CONTRACT. §11.9 forbids identity
 * pre-assignment, so there is no driver id, no name, no plate, no rating and no
 * per-driver ETA anywhere below. TowGo's own `NearbyDriver` type carried
 * `name`, `vehiclePlate` and `rating` from Phase 12's mock; Phase 16 deletes
 * them rather than serve them, because a customer who has been shown "Suresh,
 * 4.8★, 3 min away" before dispatch has run has been promised a driver the
 * matcher has not chosen and may never offer the job to.
 *
 * POSITIONS ARE SNAPPED, NOT JITTERED. Each point is rounded onto a ~100 m
 * grid. Jitter looks equivalent and is not: it re-rolls per request, so a
 * client polling every few seconds averages the noise away and recovers the
 * true position to within metres. A grid snap is stable — repeated reads return
 * the same coarse cell, and the true point is unrecoverable.
