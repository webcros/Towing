 * wave advances; `GET /bookings/:id` carries the same wave, radius and count on
 * its ten-second poll (§19.2). This hook prefers whichever is FRESHER rather
 * than picking a winner, so a customer on a working socket sees every wave and
 * a customer whose socket never connected still sees real progress — and
 * neither is ever shown invented progress, which is the acceptance criterion.
 *
 * THE OLD `useSearchSimulation` LIVED HERE. It was a `setTimeout` ladder that
 * pretended to contact drivers and produced a match after 6.5 seconds for a
 * booking that had never been created; Phase 15 deleted it and left the screen
 * honestly saying "searching" forever. This is what finally replaces it.
