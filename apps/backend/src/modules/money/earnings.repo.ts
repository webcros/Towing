   * breakdown per job").

   * **Anchored on the booking, with the legs pulled in by a lateral.** The
   * obvious alternative — walk the fleet wallet's `fleet_share_credit` rows —
   * is one index scan and is wrong: `fleet_driver_shares` permits a 100/0
   * split, which produces no fleet leg at all, and those bookings would vanish
   * from the fleet's own split table with nothing failing. The lateral is
   * driven by `idx_wallet_transactions_ref`.
   *
   * **Ordered by the booking's `created_at`, matching the jobs feed exactly** —
   * same `idx_bookings_fleet_feed`, same cursor shape, and the two tables sit
   * next to each other in the console, so ordering them differently would be a
   * surprise. `desc nulls last` on both columns because `ORDER BY … DESC`
   * implies NULLS FIRST, which does NOT match the index and makes Postgres
   * re-sort every page (the lesson Phase 4 paid for).
   *
   * The date filter is on SETTLEMENT date, not booking date: §9.3.7's statement
   * is "the money that landed this month".
