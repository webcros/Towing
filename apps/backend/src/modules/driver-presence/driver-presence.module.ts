/**
 * §6.1's candidate store and §11.3's location pipeline (Phase 16).
 *
 * `PricingModule` for `ZoneResolverService` — the point-in-polygon that decides
 * which zone partition a driver goes into is the SAME one that prices a
 * customer's pickup, and a second implementation would be a second answer to
 * "are we live here". `BookingsModule` for `DispatchConfigRepo`, which owns the
 * §6.7 stale-ping threshold. `RealtimeModule` for `WsTicketService`, so the
 * driver app mints its handshake credential through the one service that knows
 * how. Everything else (DB, cache, Redis, metrics) is `@Global()`.
 *
 * EXPORTS ARE PHASE 17'S SURFACE. `DriverCandidatesRepo` is what the matcher
 * selects from, `PresenceStore` is where its offer lock will sit beside the
 * presence keys, and `DriverPresenceService.evictRevoked` is how an admin
 * suspension reaches the candidate store. They are exported now, with a single
 * consumer each, so the matcher inherits a seam rather than inventing one.
