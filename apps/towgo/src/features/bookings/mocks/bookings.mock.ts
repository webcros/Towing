 * Detail rows are the single source of truth so the list and the details screen

 *
 * PHASE 15 REWROTE THE SHAPE, not the data: money is integer paise, timestamps
 * are ISO 8601, and the image fields are URL strings or null. Those were the
 * Phase 12 contract corrections deferred to "their own phases (15 bookings)" —
 * a mock in rupees with pre-formatted dates would have hidden every one of the
 * unit and parsing bugs the real feed can produce.
 *
 * The truck/driver artwork is `null` here: those are SERVER-sourced images, and
 * the backend has no image pipeline for them yet. The cards already render a
 * themed placeholder when they are absent, which is what mocks-off shows too.
