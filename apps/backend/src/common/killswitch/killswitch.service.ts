/**
 * §19.8's kill switches — "no deploy" is the entire requirement.
 *
 * WHAT THEY ARE FOR. Each one turns a specific incident from an outage into a
 * degradation an operator chooses: a zone where drivers cannot physically reach
 * anyone (a flood, a closed highway) is paused rather than left offering jobs
 * nobody can take; long-distance offers are the longest commitment and the first
 * thing to stop when supply is thin; forcing REST polling takes load off the
 * gateway when sockets are the thing that is unwell.
 *
 * REDIS, NOT ENV AND NOT A TABLE. An env var needs a rolling restart — minutes,
 * during exactly the incident where seconds matter. A table needs a migration
 * for each new switch and a cache on the hot path. A key is one round trip,
 * takes effect on the next wave, and the next switch is a new key.
 *
 * FAIL OPEN, DELIBERATELY. Every read below swallows its error and answers
 * "not paused". A Redis blip that silently halted all dispatch would be a far
 * worse outage than the one any of these switches exists to contain — and the
 * candidate store is in the same Redis, so a failure here means the search was
 * already about to degrade to PostGIS rather than to nothing.
 *
 * ⚠ The admin FORMS over these are Phase 20 · B3. What ships here is the
 * mechanism plus the `PUT /v1/admin/dispatch-config` route that writes it, so an
 * operator with API access can already reach every switch.
