 * TWO LAYERS, NOT ONE — this is the whole point of the Figma revision.
 *
 * The old `tow-truck-hero.png` was a single composite (489×316) with the
 * skyline baked into the truck artwork, which is why it could only ever be
 * placed as one flat block. The design separates them: a transparent truck over
 * a grey skyline held at 52% opacity and offset 20px right / 10px down, so the
 * city reads as depth behind the truck rather than as part of it.
 *
 * The composite is still used by `ServicesHero` and the driver app's
 * `OnlineStatusCard`, so it stays in the tree — it is not dead.

 *
 * The first shipped version used these numbers as absolute dp, and on the first
 * real device (360dp wide) the truck slid 30dp left into the heading: the
 * comma of "Towing," touched the cab and "Anytime" ran under the wheels. A
 * fixed-size collage only reproduces the design at exactly 390dp; every other
 * width shows a different composition. Scaling the whole frame by
 * `width / 390` shows the SAME picture everywhere, which is what the design

 * `y: -19.07` and the skyline at `y: -9.07` — both bleed ABOVE the frame's own
 * top edge. Figma's export is 390 × **181** because it renders that overflow,
 * and the export is what we reproduce: a 161-tall box with the truck
 * overflowing upward would clip the crane (RN clips overflow on Android) or
 * paint it over `AppHeader`. So each frame-space y gains 19.07:
 *
 *     truck    -19.07 + 19.07 =  0
 *     skyline   -9.07 + 19.07 = 10
 *
 * Verified by recomposing the hero from the two source PNGs and diffing
 * against the export: mean error 4.85 at these values, 7.50 at the naive
 * frame-space read, 7.11 with no skyline drawn at all — the naive read was
 * literally worse than omitting the layer.
