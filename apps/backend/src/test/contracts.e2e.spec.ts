 * responses by hand and the console trusted them, with `@towing/api-contracts`
 * agreeing with both only because a human kept it so. A type is no help — the
 * DTOs are assembled from SQL rows through `as` casts and raw `db.execute`, and
 * an extra key is invisible to TypeScript by construction.
 *
 * One table rather than an assertion scattered through each module's spec, so
 * that reading this file tells you what is covered — and a completeness guard
 * below so the table cannot quietly rot as routes are added.
