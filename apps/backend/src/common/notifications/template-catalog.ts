/**
 * §12.3's "content stored as templates" — as a TYPED CONST MAP, not a table.
 *
 * A NON-GOAL, RECORDED SO IT IS NOT REDISCOVERED: there is no admin
 * template-management UI in this phase and there should not be one later
 * either. SMS bodies must be DLT-registered with the regulator and WhatsApp
 * bodies approved by Meta, both referenced by an ID the provider issues — so an
 * admin editing body text at runtime would *break* compliance rather than
 * enable it, by desynchronising what we send from what was approved. The most
 * that is ever justified is a read-only viewer, and that belongs with Phase
 * 20's thin config screens.
 *
 * `dltTemplateId` and `waTemplateName` are null on every row today because
 * neither registration has happened (`ToBeDoneEhsan.md`). The adapters treat
 * null as a hard "cannot send" rather than falling back to free text, which is
 * what keeps the reason legible in `notification_deliveries.last_error`
 * instead of arriving as an opaque vendor 4xx.
 *
 * FOUR EMAIL TEMPLATES SHIP, TWO ARE WIRED. Plan L1100 asks for all four of
 * §12.2's email-required rows; only compliance-expiring and payout have live
 * emitters today, so `job_invoice_email` and `payment_receipt_email` sit here
 * with their variable sets agreed, waiting for Phase 19 to register a trigger
 * against them.
